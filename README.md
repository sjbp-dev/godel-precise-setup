godel-precise-setup.git
===============
Clone and run this on an Ubuntu 14.04.* LTS instance (e.g., on an EC2 instance) to
configure both the machine and your individual development environment as
follows:

```sh
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/sjbp-dev/godel-precise-setup.git
./godel-precise-setup/setup.sh
```

Note:
This is a modified version of the analogous file used in the Startup Engineering class in Coursera, modified for my needs.
